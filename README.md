# React useEffect Cleanup Function Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React where the cleanup function within the `useEffect` hook is not being called as expected. This can lead to memory leaks and unexpected behavior.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file contains a component with an `useEffect` hook. The cleanup function within this hook should run when the component unmounts or when the dependencies change.  However, in certain scenarios, particularly if the component unmounts quickly or there are other race conditions, the cleanup function might not be executed.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version that addresses this issue. The solution may involve adjusting the dependencies array or handling asynchronous operations more carefully within the effect.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
4. Observe the console output to see the effect and cleanup function logs.
5. Manipulate the component's lifecycle (mounting and unmounting) to test the behavior.
